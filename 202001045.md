# Question-1: Identify FRs and NFRs

The following are the library information system's functional and non-functional requirements:

## Functional Requirements

1.) Include information about a new book in the catalogue.<br/>
2.) Removing an existing book is no longer useful.<br/>
3.) Adding the student's or staff's information in relation to the book that was issued.<br/>
4.) Adding and deleting information on students and other institute employees.<br/>
5.) Construct a useful database to provide the best possible book search capability.<br/>
6.) User login is required for authentication and authorization.<br/>
7.) Inform the student/member of the book's specifics, including the title and deadline for returns.<br/>
8.) Update the returned book's information and make it accessible for reissue.<br/>
9.) Specifying various tasks for the administrator and the student<br/>
10.) LAN security restrictions

## Non-Functional Requirements

1.) The **performance** may be impacted by building a large system for both books and user information.<br/>
2.) **Reliability** of the system due to syncronization between database and application.<br/>
3.) To ensure **integrity** and **security**, the System would only provide its access to services for confirmed users.<br/>
4.) The system's ability to manage a lot of traffic has an impact on its ability to **scale**.<br/>
5.) User Experience.<br/>
6.) Maintainance of the system.<br/>

# Question-2: Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects

## Scope
* The product has a great scope in the current era as it has capability to help disabled persons who's population is considerable and this innovation is helping them out by solving the critical issues at time of urgency.

## Feartures
* The functions are provided through a mobile application so that it can be almost accessible to all the one's needed.<br/>
* The app uses artificial intelligence so that it can detect the issues prevailing in the surrounding and perform necessary functions.<br/>
* The tech used in the backend will recognize the key sound events of interest to the community such as car horns and other sounds where immediate alerts will be processed and the same will be notified to the user.<br/>
* The app does not require any input from the user but uses the inputs of the user's surroundings.</br>
* The app is working at low latency so it can notify the user as soon as possible.<br/>

## Non-Functional aspects
* Undesired results processed due to unnecessary inputs.<br/>
* Adding new features should be user friendly and simple to use, and focus on maintainibility.<br/>
* Performance and scalability.<br/>
* Security, Realibility, and Availability.<br/>
